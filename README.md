## JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

### Tools
Made by using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

### Description
My password generator allows a user to generate a random password by choosing a character count between 8-128 characters and whether they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. The generator then spits out a random password for the user to use.
